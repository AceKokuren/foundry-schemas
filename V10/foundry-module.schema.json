This field should be true if your package does not present any user-facing features, but rather provides functionality for other packages to utilize and rely upon. Packages with this field set to true may be hidden from third party package lists to avoid confusing users. When omitted the default value of this field is false. It is not necessary to explicitly set this value unless it needs to be true."
